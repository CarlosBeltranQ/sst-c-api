# Prerequisites

- OpenSSL (TODO: Elaborate why OpenSSL is needed).
  - On Max OS X, OpenSSL can be installed using `brew install openssl`.
  - Following environment variables need to be set before running `make`. The exact variable values can be found from the output of `brew install openssl`.
    - export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib"
    - export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include"

# C API

**void load_config()**

- load_config() is a function to load the config file.
- The reason for creating this function is that if you load a file within another function, problems of high computation and long running time occur.
- Input includes entity name, purpose, number of keys, public key path, private key path, auth ip address, port number, entity server ip, port number.
- Return struct config

**session_key_t \* get_session_key()**

- get_session_key() is a function to get secure session key from Auth.
- Input is the struct config returned from the load_config function.
- Return struct session_key

**int secure_connect_to_server()**

- secure_connect_to_server() is a function that establishes a secure connection with the entity server in the struct config.
- Input is the session key received from get_session_key() and struct config returned from load_config().
- Return secure socket

**session_key_t \* server_secure_comm_setup()**

- server_secure_comm_setup() is a function that the server continues to wait for the entity client and, if the client tries to connect, proceeds with a secure connection.
- Input is the struct config
- Return struct session_key

**void send_secure_message()**

- send secure message() is a function that enables secure communication with the server by encrypting it with the session key.
- Input includes session key, secure socket, message
- Return sequence number

**void send_secure_message()**

- send secure message() is a function that enables secure communication with the server by encrypting it with the session key.
- Input includes session key, secure socket, message
- Return sequence number

**void \*receive_thread()**

- Creates a receive_thread
- Usage:
  '''
  pthread_t thread;
  arg_struct_t args = {
  .sock = sock,
  .s_key = &session_key_list[0]};
  pthread_create(&thread, NULL, &receive_thread, (void \*)&args);
  '''

**void receive_message()**

- Enables receiving messages

# Compile

`$cd ~/entity/c`
`$make`
-Turn on two different terminals.

`$./entity_client`
`$./entity_server`

# TODO

- Implement an additional API function for extracting session key from cached session keys.
